    <h1>Why Character Tutors?</h1>

    <p class="center-text">
      I wanted to make character AI tutors that not only take advantage of the benefits of 1-on-1 pacing, personalization, and clarity — but also make the learning process more memorable and fun by gamifying it through themed, engaging personas.
      1-1 tutoring has been shown to be an unparelleled method in improving learning outcomes. 
      By leveraging Large Language Models' ability to walk each individual student through complicated processes, as well as LLMs' capacity to play the kinds of roles they are instructed to play, I made a suite of tutors designed to make teaching Gened 1188 easier and more effective in the future.

        <h2>1-on-1 Tutoring: Evidence from Bloom’s 2-Sigma Problem</h2>
        <p>Bloom's research shows that 1-on-1 tutoring can improve performance by up to two standard deviations compared to traditional teaching. That’s a major leap.</p>
        <p>While human tutors are expensive and time-limited, AI tutors—especially when customized—can deliver some of the same benefits at scale.</p>

        <h2>Kestin & Miller: AI Tutors in Action</h2>
        <p>Harvard professors Greg Kestin and Kelly Miller tested AI tutors in their physics course. Students who used their "PS2 Pal" scored higher on assessments than those in traditional lecture groups.</p>
        <p>They also showed greater improvement relative to their own baseline knowledge.</p>

        <h2>Keeping Students Engaged</h2>
        <p>In the same study by Kestin and Miller, students reported higher levels of engagement, motivation, and enjoyment when learning with an AI tutor rather than through passive lectures. This matters just as much as test performance.</p>
        <p>If a student enjoys learning, they’re more likely to stick with it, ask questions, and absorb the material deeply (and having fun is a bonus, too!).</p>

        <h2>Designing Better Prompts</h2>
        <p>Though I decided on my project before seeing Kestin and Miller's results or methods, I was inspired by methods employed in their own PS2 Pal's design.</p>
        <p>They designed their bot to encourage active learning, rather than simply replicating traditional learning, by giving answers in pieces and providing practice content.</p>
        <p>Their system prompt for PS2 Pal emphasized:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Active engagement</li>
          <li>Guided inquiry</li>
          <li>Encouragement and feedback</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This philosophy informed how I designed the system prompts behind each of my own tutors, which you can see on the Prompts pages.</p>

        <h2>Example-Based Learning</h2>
        <p>One of my key beliefs is that examples and metaphors make learning sticky. That’s why my wizard-themed tutor doesn’t just lecture — he teaches with spells, potions, and stories that map to real AI concepts.</p>
        <p>Talking to friends and classmates, and reflecting on my experience in this class and in other classes, I learn best when I'm enjoying what I'm learning, and when I have examples or analogies to connect concepts to.</p>
        <p>For example, a friend in my Statistics course said he finally understood the concept of a "Pivot" distribution in building confidence intervals when it was explained in reference to the "pivot foot" in basketball.</p>
        <p>Rather than have a generic tutor like in PS2 Pal, I made the tutors each have fun character personas to motivate learning even further and offer more flexibility so that each student could pick a character they'd learn best from.</p>
        <p>For example, as someone who used to read lots of fantasy books, I would love learning in medieval or fantasy metaphors from a wizard tutor. What fantasy fan wouldn't want Gandalf teaching them?</p>
        <p>In my miniature experiment involving students not in Gened 1188, students found these character-driven metaphors both more memorable and more fun. Future Gened 1188 courses could employ these tutors for a semester, studying the effects of their use on student engagement, motivation, and performance at the end of the term, to have more data (my experiment was just a small, simplified demo of what this could look like)</p>
